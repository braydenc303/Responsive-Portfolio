            <p>After several years in the Food and Beverage industry, cooking dinner and pouring
            a drink come easily for me. As a Bootcamp student I get the chance to learn and
            solve new problems everyday. Who am I kidding? I get to solve new problems by the
            minute. Embarking on a new career in web design is a challenge
            that I welcome and look forward to. 
            </p>
            <p>Problem solving itself is not new to me however. Not only am I a well trained cook,
            but I also have a background in machining, welding, and a little motorcycle maintenance.
            In addition to all of that, I am also the father of a 13 year old, so needless to say, I have 
            have had plenty of practice solving problems.
