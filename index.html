      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/IMG_4471.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>After several years in the Food and Beverage industry, cooking dinner and pouring
        a drink come easily for me. As a Bootcamp student I get the chance to learn and
        solve new problems everyday. Who am I kidding? I get to solve new problems by the
        minute. Embarking on a new career in web design is a challenge
        that I welcome and look forward to. 
        </p>
        <p>Problem solving itself is not new to me however. Not only am I a well trained cook,
        but I also have a background in machining, welding, and a little motorcycle maintenance.
        In addition to all of that, I am also the father of a 13 year old, so needless to say, I have 
        have had plenty of practice solving problems.
